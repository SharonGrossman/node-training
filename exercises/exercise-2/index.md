# Exercise 2 - HTTP

### Duration
`1.5 days`

### Code Review
`Trainer + 1`

## Summary
Before using complex web frameworks for handling requests and responses,
we’ll use the native http module that Node.js exports to implement our basic web server.

### Recommended Modules
`http`

## Tasks
* Use the native http module and serve a basic index.html file with ‘Hello World’ shown in the browser on port 9090
* Enhance your server: add a route ‘/get’ that will download a basic .txt file of your choosing upon entering this route
* If the client gets to an unavailable route, display a 404.html file with a proper message
